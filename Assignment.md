## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes 😅).
For each one, tell us:

What you thought it would be like `(Expectation 👀)`

What you actually learned `(Reality 😅)`

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project 💻

**Example format:**

`Concept: GitHub Project Boards`

`Expectation 👀`: Looked like a complicated tool only teams use.

`Reality 😅`: It’s actually a visual to-do list! Dragging my tasks from “To do” to “Done” felt so satisfying.

`Impact 💡`: Helped me stay organized and track my progress on the portfolio, especially when I had lots of sections to build.

Concept: Git Branching
Expectation: I assumed branches were only for huge professional teams and that I’d get lost trying to use them.
Reality: Branches turned out to be simple, personal workspaces. I spun up one for each feature (like login-page) and kept my main code perfectly safe.
Impact: Gave me the freedom to tinker with new ideas in EduChain without worrying I’d break everything already working.

Concept: Pull Requests (PRs)
Expectation: PRs sounded formal and scary—like something you needed a whole committee to approve.
Reality: They’re basically friendly and writing the description made me pause, review my own changes, and feel proud of each milestone.
Impact: Made my workflow feel professional and let me keep a tidy history of improvements on the login and about pages.

Concept: Git Commit Messages
Expectation: I figured any old message would do and that nobody would ever read them.
Reality: Clear messages like feat: add responsive login form come in handy when I need to trace what changed and why.
Impact: My EduChain repo now reads like a diary of progress helpful for when showing classmates or potential employers what I did.

Concept: GitHub Pages Deployment
Expectation: I thought launching a site required complicated servers or paid hosting.
Reality: GitHub Pages is literally simple and my site was live in minutes.
Impact: I now have a public link to share with friends and reviewers, so they can see EduChain in action anytime.


## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features
